## Architectural Guide 

### 1. CI/CD Best Practices

- Build fully automated CI/CD pipelines with tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, or ArgoCD.
- Separate pipeline stages: Source, Build, Test, Security Scan, Package, Artifact Storage, Deploy, Post-Deploy Verification, Rollback
- Use environment-specific variables and secrets for each stage.
- Use containerized build environments for consistency.
- Integrate static code analysis and security scanning.
- Employ canary and blue-green deployments for zero downtime.
- Enable automated rollbacks on failure.
- Trigger pipelines on code commits; follow GitOps principles.
- Manage artifacts with version control and promote across environments.
- Monitor deployments and performance with Prometheus and Grafana.
- Secure credentials using AWS Secrets Manager or Vault.

---

### 2. AWS Cloud Best Practices

- Use a multi-account strategy for environment separation (dev/stage/prod).
- Apply least privilege IAM roles and policies.
- Enable CloudTrail and Config for auditing and compliance.
- Enforce resource tagging for visibility and cost allocation.
- Use autoscaling groups and ELBs for high availability.
- Design VPCs with private/public subnets, NAT gateways, and security groups.
- Automate backups with AWS Backup.
- Use S3 with lifecycle policies and versioning.
- Manage infrastructure as code with Terraform or CloudFormation.
- Monitor with CloudWatch, X-Ray, and GuardDuty.

---

### 3. Security Best Practices

- Secure APIs and endpoints with OAuth2 and RBAC.
- Centralize logging and alerting for intrusion detection.
- Rotate IAM credentials; use short-lived tokens.
- Encrypt data at rest (EBS, S3) and in transit (TLS 1.2+).
- Scan container images and code repositories for vulnerabilities.
- Use WAF and Shield for DDoS protection.
- Conduct regular security audits and compliance checks.
- Apply OS hardening and patching.
- Enforce MFA and conditional access.
- Audit IAM changes and enforce least privilege.

---

### 4. Automation Best Practices

- Automate repetitive tasks with scripts or tools like Ansible.
- Maintain an automation playbook for remediation.
- Schedule jobs with Airflow or Lambda triggers.
- Automate alert responses with runbooks and self-healing.
- Integrate monitoring with automated ticketing (PagerDuty, JIRA).
- Use configuration management for consistent environments.
- Create automation tests for infrastructure changes.
- Implement continuous compliance checks.
- Monitor and log automation events.
- Version control all automation scripts and templates.

---

### 5. Kubernetes Architecture

- Use managed Kubernetes (EKS) for simplified upgrades and security.
- Deploy with Helm charts and Kustomize for environment differences.
- Use namespaces for isolation and RBAC for access control.
- Set up network policies and PodSecurityPolicies.
- Enable autoscaling at node and pod levels.
- Use sidecars for logging, monitoring, and security.
- Monitor with Prometheus, Grafana, and Fluentd.
- Secure etcd and API server access.
- Backup etcd and use Velero for disaster recovery.
- Apply liveness and readiness probes.

---

### 6. Observability Architecture

- Centralize logging with ELK or Loki stack.
- Implement tracing with OpenTelemetry and Jaeger.
- Collect metrics with Prometheus; expose custom metrics.
- Build dashboards in Grafana.
- Set up synthetic and real-user monitoring.
- Use alerting based on SLO/SLA violations.
- Correlate logs, metrics, and traces for incident resolution.
- Store logs and metrics with proper retention and access controls.
- Create incident response playbooks.
- Use anomaly detection and ML for predictive monitoring.

---

### 7. High Availability Architecture

- Design stateless services; store state in distributed storage.
- Deploy across multiple AZs and regions as needed.
- Use load balancers (ALB/NLB) with health checks.
- Configure auto-scaling groups and policies.
- Implement retries and circuit breakers.
- Use message queues (SQS, Kafka) for decoupling.
- Design databases with replication and failover (RDS, Aurora).
- Enable cross-region replication for DR.
- Regularly test failover and DR plans.
- Apply throttling and backpressure to prevent cascading failures.

---

### 8. Identity and Access Management (IAM) Architecture

- Centralize IAM with AWS IAM, Okta, or Auth0.
- Enforce SSO and RBAC across services.
- Integrate MFA for privileged accounts.
- Rotate credentials and monitor access logs.
- Use identity federation for cross-platform access.
- Define fine-grained IAM policies.
- Automate user lifecycle events.
- Track permission changes with audit trails.
- Regularly review access policies.
- Integrate IAM with CI/CD and monitoring for context-aware access.

---

### 9. GitOps Architecture

- Store all infrastructure and app configs in Git.
- Use ArgoCD or FluxCD to sync Git state with clusters.
- Use PR-based workflows with approvals.
- Track changes and rollbacks via Git history.
- Automate promotion between environments.
- Maintain separate branches for dev/stage/prod.
- Use templates and overlays for customization.
- Monitor Git sync status and reconcile drift.
- Integrate with policy engines (OPA, Kyverno).
- Educate teams on GitOps workflows and security.

---

### 10. Disaster Recovery Architecture

- Define RTO and RPO for all services.
- Automate backups and test restores.
- Replicate data across regions or DR sites.
- Use DNS failover (Route53, Cloudflare).
- Document and automate DR procedures.
- Schedule regular DR drills.
- Maintain hot/warm standby environments.
- Version control all DR scripts and configs.
- Monitor DR readiness.
- Align DR with compliance and business continuity plans.
