# IAM Reliability Engineering Blueprint

Welcome to the **IAM Reliability Engineering Blueprint**, a reference implementation designed for high-impact Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) working on Identity and Access Management (IAM) platforms. This repository demonstrates design patterns, automation practices, and tooling integrations aligned with Procore’s expectations for a Staff SRE - IAM.

## 🧩 Core Responsibilities

### ✅ Ownership & Leadership
This project emphasizes leading IAM-related reliability engineering initiatives with autonomy. It includes:
- Modular ownership boundaries for IAM subsystems.
- GitOps-driven architecture for change control.
- Reliability scorecard templates.

### 🩺 Platform Health
Designed to enhance the **availability, performance, and reliability** of critical IAM systems:
- Health checks for authentication, authorization, and entitlements services.
- Service-level indicators (SLIs) and objectives (SLOs) with Alertmanager configs.
- Fault-injection and chaos engineering practices.

### 🤖 Automation First
Reduce operational toil through:
- Automated incident response runbooks.
- Terraform modules to manage IAM roles, policies, and service accounts.
- GitHub Actions for validating security group updates.

### 🤝 Collaboration
Blueprints and code are structured for cross-functional extensibility:
- Clear README per component.
- API documentation for inter-team consumption.
- Collaboration templates for RFCs and design reviews.

## 🚀 Strategic Impact

### 🎯 Customer-Facing Reliability
- Live demo apps instrumented for latency and failure simulation.
- Example SLOs for login latency and token issuance uptime.

### 🧑‍🏫 Mentorship
- Templates for onboarding new SREs.
- Contribution guidelines and internal wikis for engineering best practices.

### 🌍 Open Source Culture
- Modular, reusable, and PR-reviewed IaC modules.
- Encouragement for upstream contributions to shared tooling (e.g., Fluent Bit, Loki).
- Maintainer guide to foster transparent review cycles.
