# RFC(Request For Comment/Change): [Title]

## Overview
Briefly summarize the proposal.  
_Example:_  
This RFC proposes introducing a centralized logging system using ELK Stack to improve observability and troubleshooting.

## Motivation
Explain why this change is needed.  
_Example:_  
Currently, logs are scattered across multiple servers, making debugging difficult. A centralized solution will streamline monitoring and incident response.

## Design
Describe the proposed solution in detail.  
_Steps:_  
1. Deploy Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana using Docker Compose.
2. Configure application servers to forward logs to Logstash.
3. Set up Kibana dashboards for visualization.
4. Implement access controls for log data.

_Example:_  
- Use Filebeat agents on each server to ship logs to Logstash.
- Logstash parses and forwards logs to Elasticsearch.
- Kibana provides dashboards for real-time analysis.

## Alternatives
List other approaches considered and why they were not chosen.  
_Example:_  
- **Graylog:** Rejected due to limited community support.
- **Cloud-based logging (e.g., AWS CloudWatch):** Not chosen due to data residency requirements.

## Impact
Describe the effects of this change.  
_Example:_  
- **Positive:** Faster troubleshooting, improved compliance.
- **Negative:** Additional infrastructure costs, initial setup effort.
