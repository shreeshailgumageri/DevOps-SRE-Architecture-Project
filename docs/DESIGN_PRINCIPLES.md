# Design Principles for IAM Reliability Engineering

## 1. Modular, Reusable Infrastructure

- **Define clear module boundaries:** Break down IAM components (e.g., user provisioning, role management, policy enforcement) into independent, well-documented modules.
- **Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Implement all IAM resources using IaC tools (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) to ensure consistency and repeatability.
- **Promote reusability:** Design modules to be parameterized and environment-agnostic, enabling reuse across projects and environments.
- **Version control:** Store all modules in a version-controlled repository to track changes and facilitate rollbacks.
- **Testing and validation:** Develop automated tests for modules to validate functionality and prevent regressions.

## 2. Automation-First Approach

- **Automate provisioning:** Use CI/CD pipelines to automate the deployment and configuration of IAM resources.
- **Self-healing mechanisms:** Implement automated remediation for common IAM failures (e.g., policy drift, orphaned accounts).
- **Policy enforcement:** Automate compliance checks and policy enforcement using tools like OPA or AWS Config Rules.
- **Lifecycle management:** Automate user and role lifecycle events (onboarding, offboarding, access reviews) to reduce manual intervention.
- **Documentation generation:** Automatically generate and update documentation for IAM configurations and changes.

## 3. Observable and Reliable by Default

- **Comprehensive logging:** Enable detailed logging for all IAM actions and changes (e.g., CloudTrail, Azure AD logs).
- **Metrics and monitoring:** Expose key metrics (e.g., failed logins, policy changes, permission escalations) and set up alerts for anomalies.
- **Health checks:** Implement automated health checks for critical IAM components and integrations.
- **Incident response:** Integrate IAM monitoring with incident management systems for rapid detection and response.
- **Auditability:** Ensure all IAM changes are traceable and auditable, supporting compliance and forensic analysis.
