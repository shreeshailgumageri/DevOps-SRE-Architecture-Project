### 11. Terraform Best Practices

#### 1. Use Remote State Storage
Store Terraform state files remotely (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage) and enable state locking to prevent concurrent modifications.

#### 2. Organize Code with Modules
Break infrastructure code into reusable modules to promote consistency and reduce duplication.

#### 3. Use Version Control
Keep all Terraform code and modules in version control systems like Git for collaboration and change tracking.

#### 4. Write Descriptive Variable and Resource Names
Use clear and descriptive names for variables, resources, and outputs to improve readability and maintainability.

#### 5. Use Workspaces for Environment Separation
Leverage Terraform workspaces or separate state files to manage different environments (dev, staging, prod).

#### 6. Pin Provider Versions
Specify exact provider versions in your configuration to ensure consistent deployments and avoid breaking changes.

#### 7. Enable Plan and Review Process
Always run `terraform plan` before `terraform apply` and review the proposed changes to avoid unintended modifications.

#### 8. Manage Secrets Securely
Never store secrets or sensitive data in code or state files. Use environment variables or secret management tools.

#### 9. Use Terraform Format and Validate
Run `terraform fmt` and `terraform validate` to enforce code style and catch syntax errors early.

#### 10. Document Your Code
Add comments and documentation for complex resources, modules, and variables to help future maintainers.

#### 11. Implement Resource Tagging
Tag resources consistently for cost tracking, ownership, and management.

#### 12. Limit Resource Permissions
Follow the principle of least privilege for IAM roles and service accounts used by Terraform.

#### 13. Test Infrastructure Changes
Use tools like `terraform plan`, `terraform validate`, and automated CI/CD pipelines to test changes before applying them.

#### 14. Clean Up Unused Resources
Regularly review and remove unused resources to reduce costs and security risks.

#### 15. Monitor and Audit Infrastructure
Enable logging and monitoring for infrastructure managed by Terraform to detect issues and maintain compliance.
