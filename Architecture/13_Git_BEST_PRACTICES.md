# Version Control Best Practices

## 1. Use Meaningful Commit Messages
- Write clear, concise commit messages that describe the purpose of the change.
- Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add feature" not "Added feature").

## 2. Branching Strategy
- Use feature branches for new features or bug fixes.
- Protect the main branch (e.g., `main` or `master`) by requiring pull requests for changes.
- Consider using Git Flow, GitHub Flow, or trunk-based development based on your team's needs.

## 3. Code Reviews
- Require code reviews before merging changes.
- Use pull requests to facilitate discussion and feedback.

## 4. Atomic Commits
- Make small, focused commits that address a single concern.
- Avoid mixing unrelated changes in one commit.

## 5. Regular Pulls and Rebases
- Frequently pull changes from the main branch to keep your branch up to date.
- Use rebase to maintain a clean, linear history when appropriate.

## 6. Tagging and Releases
- Use tags to mark release points (e.g., `v1.0.0`).
- Maintain a changelog for each release.

## 7. Ignore Unnecessary Files
- Use `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts, secrets, and other non-source files.

## 8. Backup and Remote Repositories
- Push changes to a remote repository regularly to prevent data loss.
- Use trusted platforms (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).

## 9. Security Best Practices
- Never commit sensitive information (passwords, API keys).
- Use tools to scan for secrets before pushing.

## 10. Pre-commit Checks
- Use automated tools (e.g., pre-commit, Husky) to run checks before committing.
- Enforce code formatting and linting to maintain code quality.
- Run tests to ensure code correctness.
- Check for large files or sensitive data before committing.
- Validate commit messages against a standard format.
- Ensure that files have the correct line endings and no trailing whitespace.

## 11. Documentation
- Document your branching strategy and workflow in the repository.
- Provide onboarding guides for new contributors.
