### 12. Ansible Best Practices

#### 1. Organize Your Project Structure

- Use a clear directory structure: separate inventories, playbooks, roles, and group_vars/host_vars.
- Example:
    ```
    ├── inventories/
    ├── playbooks/
    ├── roles/
    ├── group_vars/
    ├── host_vars/
    └── ansible.cfg
    ```

#### 2. Use Roles for Reusability

- Break playbooks into roles for modularity and reuse.
- Place tasks, handlers, templates, and files within each role.

#### 3. Manage Variables Effectively

- Use `group_vars` and `host_vars` for environment-specific variables.
- Avoid hardcoding values in playbooks.

#### 4. Use Inventories Wisely

- Maintain separate inventories for different environments (dev, staging, prod).
- Use dynamic inventories for cloud environments.

#### 5. Write Idempotent Playbooks

- Ensure tasks can be run multiple times without causing unintended changes.
- Use Ansible modules that support idempotency.

#### 6. Version Control

- Store all Ansible code in a version control system (e.g., Git).
- Exclude sensitive data and use `.gitignore` for secrets.

#### 7. Secure Sensitive Data

- Use Ansible Vault to encrypt passwords, keys, and sensitive variables.
- Never store plain text secrets in your repository.

#### 8. Test Your Playbooks

- Use tools like `ansible-lint` for static analysis.
- Test playbooks in a staging environment before production.

#### 9. Use Tags

- Tag tasks and roles to allow selective execution.
- Example: `ansible-playbook site.yml --tags "webserver"`

#### 10. Documentation

- Document your playbooks, roles, and variables.
- Use `README.md` files and comments within YAML files.

#### 11. Limit Privilege Escalation

- Use `become` only when necessary.
- Limit the use of root privileges to essential tasks.

#### 12. Continuous Integration

- Integrate Ansible runs into CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
